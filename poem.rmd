## Last Verse
In numbers' realm, where patterns reside,  
Statistical math takes us on a wondrous ride.  
Probability unfolds its mystical charm,  
Unveiling secrets, a statistical alarm.  

Regression lines, gracefully they sway,  
Mapping trends, illuminating the way.  
From scatterplots to correlation's embrace, 
Statistical math paints the data's grace.
